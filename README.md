# Autoenocders-with-CNN-Classification

This repository contains code to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Autoencoder models on the MNIST handwritten dataset. Additionally, it provides functionality to predict autoencoder-generated images using the CNN.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the machine learning community for handwritten digit classification tasks. In this repository, we provide scripts to train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset and to predict autoencoder-generated images using the trained CNN.

## Contents


  - `autoencoder.ipynb`: Script to train the Autoencoder model on the MNIST handwritten dataset and load cnn model to predict.
  
  - `mnist_gan.ipynb`: Script to  train CNN model also contains some gan testing implementation.

  - `cnn_mnist_model.h5`: Load CNN model .
  
  - `autencoder_mnist.h5`: Load autoencoder model .

## Usage
